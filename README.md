# Image-Search-Engine
An Image Search Engine(ISE) build on Python3 using PIL and PyQt5.

An Image Search Engine (ISE) helps to find for a number of relatable images the user is looking for.

This ISE is build on Python3.
IDE used : Spyder3

I have used :
-- id for each dataset images
-- tags of each image
-- description of each image
for identifying the image the user is looking for

This also includes the image modification. If a user wants to view a desired image in, say Sepia, the image will be available in that filter.
I have currently implemented
-- Grayscale
-- Sepia
-- Negative
filters and also scaled it to
-- thumbnail

The GUI contains a window containing a 
-- textbox - to provide search tag or required image,i.e. Italy, Lamborghini, Rome,etc.
-- Combobox - to choose between different filters, i.e. Sepia, Grayscale etc.
-- Submit button

It is developed on PyQt5.9

PS : I will be adding more filters and different blending operations soon.
